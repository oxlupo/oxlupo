### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**oxlupo/oxlupo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

my experience in Natural Language Processing is more about:

- Extract Named Entity Recognition(NER) and their relations
- Research on graph theories
- I have worked more on BERT and Transformers model 

Besides these, I really interested in Decenetrilezed finance(DeFi) and engaged in research in the financial and economic fields Because DeFi is a new Topic, I try to focus and research more on its risks and opportunities
