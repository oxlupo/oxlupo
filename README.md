### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my experience in Natural Language Processing(NLP) is more about:

- Extract Named Entity Recognition(NER) and their relations
- Research on graph theories
- I have worked more on BERT, Transformers, Rebel and Roberta model 

Besides these, I really interested in Decenetrilezed finance(DeFi) and engaged in research in the financial and economic fields Because DeFi is a new Topic, I try to focus and research more on its risks and opportunities
